# MIDI2NES - Updated Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Audio Processing Integration (High Priority)
**Status**: Partially implemented in implementation_examples.py but not integrated

### 1.1 Envelope Processing Integration (1-2 weeks)
- **Current Status**: Basic implementation exists in EnvelopeProcessor class but needs integration
- **Tasks**:
  - Move EnvelopeProcessor from implementation_examples.py to nes_emulator_core.py
  - Integrate envelope processing into process_all_tracks
  - Add envelope type selection in track_mapper.py
  - Update exporters to handle envelope control bytes
  - Add envelope presets to nes_audio_constants.py

### 1.2 Pitch Processing Integration (1-2 weeks)
- **Current Status**: Basic implementation exists in PitchProcessor class but needs integration
- **Tasks**:
  - Move PitchProcessor from implementation_examples.py to nes_emulator_core.py
  - Integrate channel-specific pitch limitations
  - Implement full NES note table
  - Add pitch bend support in parser.py
  - Update compile_channel_to_frames to use PitchProcessor

## Phase 2: Advanced Channel Features (High Priority)
**Status**: Not implemented

### 2.1 Channel-Specific Effects (1-2 weeks)
- Implement duty cycle patterns for pulse channels
- Add triangle channel linear counter support
- Enhance noise channel with periodic noise support
- Implement volume slides and tremolo

### 2.2 DPCM Channel Enhancements (1 week)
- Improve DPCM sample management
- Add sample bank support
- Implement delta counter optimization
- Add loop point support for samples

## Phase 3: Tempo and Pattern Control (Medium Priority)
**Status**: Basic implementation only

### 3.1 Enhanced Tempo Processing (1-2 weeks)
- Add proper MIDI tempo change handling
- Implement variable frame rate support
- Add tempo ramping capabilities
- Create TempoProcessor class

### 3.2 Pattern and Loop Support (1-2 weeks)
- Add pattern definitions and markers
- Implement loop point processing
- Add jump table support
- Create pattern optimization system

## Phase 4: Export and Format Enhancements (Medium Priority)
**Status**: Basic implementation only

### 4.1 Export Format Improvements (1-2 weeks)
- Enhance CA65 assembly output
- Add compression for repeated patterns
- Implement efficient jump tables
- Add segment support

### 4.2 Multi-song Support (1-2 weeks)
- Add song bank support
- Implement segment management
- Add metadata handling
- Create song switching capabilities

## Phase 5: Optimization and Testing (Low Priority)
**Status**: Minimal implementation

### 5.1 Memory Optimization (1 week)
- Implement pattern reuse detection
- Add data compression
- Optimize frame data storage
- Reduce redundant data

### 5.2 Testing Framework (1 week)
- Create unit tests for all components
- Add integration tests
- Implement audio verification tests
- Add performance benchmarks

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Parser Improvements**
- Add MIDI CC handling
- Improve tempo change detection
- Enhance track metadata

2. **Track Mapper Enhancements**
- Improve channel assignment algorithm
- Add intelligent polyphony handling
- Implement dynamic channel reassignment

3. **Audio Generation**
- Complete envelope implementation
- Add all NES audio features
- Implement proper effect handling

4. **Export System**
- Optimize output formats
- Add compression
- Implement all NES audio features

## Implementation Notes

1. **Priority Changes**:
   - Moved envelope and pitch processing to highest priority as they're partially implemented
   - Shifted pattern support to medium priority as it depends on core audio features
   - Kept optimization as lower priority but necessary for final release

2. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Start with existing implementations in implementation_examples.py
   - Integrate into core processing pipeline
   - Add new features progressively
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration tests for full pipeline
   - Audio verification tests
   - Performance benchmarks
