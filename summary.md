# MIDI to NES Compiler Project Summary

## Project Overview

The MIDI to NES Compiler is a Python-based tool that converts standard MIDI files into NES-compatible audio data for use in homebrew NES games or chiptune music. The project implements a pipeline that processes MIDI files through several stages:

1. **Parse**: Convert MIDI to intermediate JSON format
2. **Map**: Assign MIDI tracks to NES channels
3. **Frames**: Generate frame-by-frame audio data
4. **Export**: Output as assembly or FamiTracker format

## Current Status

The project has a functional basic implementation with:

- MIDI parsing using the mido library
- Track mapping to NES channels (2 pulse, 1 triangle, 1 noise, 1 DPCM)
- Basic frame generation with pitch and volume
- Export to CA65 assembly and FamiTracker NSF text format
- DPCM sample conversion and management

## Updated Documentation

We've created or updated the following documentation:

1. **project_analysis.md**: Comprehensive analysis of the current implementation, including:
   - Core components and their limitations
   - Technical debt and issues
   - Implementation priorities
   - Testing considerations
   - Project structure and data flow
   - Dependencies and requirements
   - Future enhancements

2. **implementation_plan.md**: Detailed plan for the next phases of development:
   - Phase 1: Envelope and Duty Cycle Implementation (2-3 weeks)
   - Phase 2: NES Pitch Tables and Channel Limitations (1-2 weeks)
   - Phase 3: Tempo and Pattern Control (1-2 weeks)
   - Phase 4: Multi-song Support (2-3 weeks)
   - Testing strategy and release plan

3. **implementation_examples.py**: Code examples for the planned features:
   - EnvelopeProcessor class for ADSR envelope handling
   - PitchProcessor class for channel-specific pitch limitations
   - Enhanced tempo handling with accurate timing
   - Multi-song support in the CA65 exporter

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project are:

1. Implement the EnvelopeProcessor class to add ADSR envelope support
2. Integrate duty cycle patterns for pulse channels
3. Add channel-specific pitch limitations and effects
4. Enhance tempo handling for more accurate timing
5. Add pattern and loop support for more complex compositions
6. Implement multi-song support for game development

## Long-term Vision

The long-term vision for this project is to create a comprehensive MIDI to NES conversion tool that can be used by chiptune musicians and NES game developers. With the planned enhancements and optimizations, the tool could become a valuable asset for the retro gaming and chiptune communities, enabling the creation of high-quality NES music from modern MIDI compositions.

## Conclusion

The MIDI to NES Compiler project has a solid foundation but requires several key enhancements to produce production-quality NES audio. The updated documentation and implementation plan provide a clear roadmap for the next phases of development, focusing on sound quality improvements, advanced features, and optimization techniques.
