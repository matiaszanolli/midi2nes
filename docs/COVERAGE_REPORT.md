## 🔍 Analysis by Component

### Core Engine Components (High Priority)
- **Pattern Detection**: 95% coverage ✅
- **Emulator Core**: 98% coverage ✅ 
- **CA65 Exporter**: 100% coverage ✅
- **Configuration**: 94% coverage ✅

### Audio Processing (Medium Priority)
- **DPCM Sampling**: 54% coverage ❌
- **Drum Engine**: 37% coverage ❌
- **Envelope Processing**: 55% coverage ❌

### Project Management (Low Priority)

## 🎯 Coverage Improvement Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (v0.4.0)
1. **Add benchmarking tests** for `performance_suite.py`
2. **Add profiling utility tests** for `utils/profiling.py`
3. **Improve tempo map coverage** - currently at 64%

### Medium-term Goals (v0.5.0)
1. **DPCM system testing** - improve from 54% to 80%+
2. **Envelope processor testing** - improve from 55% to 80%+
3. **Project builder testing** - improve from 52% to 80%+

### Technical Debt
1. **Remove dead code** in `exporter/exporter.py` and `pattern_exporter.py`
2. **Refactor large modules** like `tempo_map.py` (413 lines)
3. **Add integration tests** for end-to-end workflows

## 💡 Quality Insights

### Strengths
- **Core processing pipeline** has excellent coverage (95%+)
- **Export functionality** is well-tested (96-100%)
- **Configuration system** thoroughly tested (94%)
- **All 186 tests passing** with no regressions

### Areas for Improvement
- **Audio processing components** need more comprehensive testing
- **Error handling paths** may be under-tested
- **Edge cases** in complex algorithms (tempo mapping, DPCM)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Create benchmarking tests** to cover new infrastructure
2. **Focus on audio components** (DPCM, drums, envelopes)
3. **Add integration tests** for complete pipelines
4. **Set coverage targets** for v0.4.0 release (target: 75% core coverage)
