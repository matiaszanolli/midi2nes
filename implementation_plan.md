# MIDI to NES Compiler - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Envelope and Duty Cycle Implementation (2-3 weeks)

### Week 1: Envelope Processing Framework
- Create `EnvelopeProcessor` class in `nes_emulator_core.py`
- Implement basic ADSR envelope structure
- Add envelope definitions to `nes_audio_constants.py`
- Update frame generation to include envelope data

### Week 2: Duty Cycle Integration
- Integrate duty cycle patterns from `nes_audio_constants.py`
- Add duty cycle selection logic to `track_mapper.py`
- Implement duty cycle byte sequence generation
- Update pulse channel processing to use duty cycles

### Week 3: Export Integration and Testing
- Update `exporter_ca65.py` to include envelope control bytes
- Update `exporter_nsftxt.py` for FamiTracker envelope compatibility
- Create test cases for envelope processing
- Verify output with NES emulator

## Phase 2: NES Pitch Tables and Channel Limitations (1-2 weeks)

### Week 1: Pitch Processing Enhancements
- Create `PitchProcessor` class in `nes_emulator_core.py`
- Implement channel-specific pitch range validation
- Add octave shifting for out-of-range notes
- Implement pitch bend support

### Week 2: Testing and Integration
- Update exporters to handle pitch effects
- Create test cases for pitch processing
- Verify output with NES emulator
- Document pitch limitations and workarounds

## Phase 3: Tempo and Pattern Control (1-2 weeks)

### Week 1: Enhanced Tempo Handling
- Improve tempo change handling in `parser.py`
- Create `TempoProcessor` class
- Add tempo metadata to frame data
- Implement dynamic tempo adjustment

### Week 2: Pattern and Loop Support
- Add pattern jump markers and loop points
- Update exporters to handle pattern jumps
- Create test cases for tempo and pattern control
- Document pattern control features

## Phase 4: Multi-song Support (2-3 weeks)

### Week 1: Song Segment Framework
- Add song segment definitions
- Implement segment metadata structure
- Create segment management logic

### Week 2: Memory Optimization
- Implement memory-efficient segment storage
- Add pattern reuse across segments
- Create segment jump tables

### Week 3: Export Integration and Testing
- Update exporters to handle multiple songs
- Create test cases for multi-song support
- Verify output with NES emulator
- Document multi-song features

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Create test cases for each new component
- Verify envelope processing accuracy
- Test pitch conversion and limitations
- Validate tempo and pattern control

### Integration Testing
- Test full pipeline with various MIDI files
- Verify memory usage and optimization
- Test multi-song functionality

### Audio Testing
- Use NES emulator to verify audio output
- Compare with reference implementations
- Test on real NES hardware if available

## Documentation Updates

- Update README with new features
- Create usage examples for each new feature
- Document API changes and new parameters
- Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
